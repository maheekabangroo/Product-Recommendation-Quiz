PROJECT TITLE
Sciatica Stage Predictor based on neural networks using Python and Tensorflow.

FEATURES
- Predicts the stage of sciatica based on user-provided answers.
- Displays recommendations corresponding to the predicted stage.
- Simple and intuitive GUI for user interaction.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project helps predict the severity stage of sciatica, a condition causing pain in the lower back and legs, based on how someone answers specific questions about their symptoms. There are 8 set of questions that a customer must answer based on their condition's symptoms. Upon answering the multiple choice questions, the model will assign a consition stage to the customer. The stages range from Stage 1 to Stage 5 in the order of increasing severity. The customer will be recommended a product kit by the model based on their answers to the questions.
